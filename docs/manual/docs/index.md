## What’s new in GeoNetwork 5

GeoNetwork 5 is the next big step in the project’s evolution. Its highlight is native support for the OGC API Records standard, bringing web-native, standards-based catalog services. Even though it’s still under development, you can already run it alongside GeoNetwork 4.4 and publish your existing catalogs through this new API, combining the stability of today with the possibilities of tomorrow.
